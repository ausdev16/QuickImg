# Privacy Policy for AuWeather

1. Does this application collect or use your personal information?

AuWeather uses your internet connection to download and update the content. This application doesnâ€™t implement its own methods to:

Collect & use any personal information
Store any personal data
Share it to third party

HOWEVER, what it does do is the following:

Uses Windows 10 Analytics

This information is used by the developer to view stats, and fix bugs. As this is Microsoft's own implementation of Analytics, it should follow your Privacy settings set in Windows Settings > Privacy > Feedback and Diagnostics.

Uses your device location

AuWeather will use your device location (including your GPS, if you have one) to automatically detect your location when adding a new favourite if you click on this button, or, if you use the "Auto" location as your first perference (ie the top of the favourite list.)

This is not saved and is calculated dymanically each time it is used.
