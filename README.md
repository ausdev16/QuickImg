# QuickImg
QuickImg is a lightweight, fast image viewer. Unlike others, it doesn't add bloat such as photo libraries, projects, etc.

I've decided to Open Source this as I no longer have enough time to maintain it. This is released under the BSD licence. It was originally meant to be a quick & easy project for me to learn UWP, however, it turnes out a lot of the features were quite complex to implement and had no equivalent in example code elsewhere.

Feel free to could contribute to the code to fix bugs, improvements, etc. However, please keep in mind that any new features should stay true to the original aim, which is a small, essential features only, image viewer. It is NOT an image editor, project manager, library, etc. It's sole purpose it to quickly view image files and be easy to use for the average user. I will offer the compiled appx here and also on the Microsoft Store after enough updates.

If you use the code in  your own project, again, you don't have to, but it would be nice if you could offer credit etc. However, feel free to use the code if it helps.
